  - Calculates jerk values for X, Y, and Z axes.
  - Controls NeoPixel LED colors based on jerk values.
  - Logs data to a CSV file and outputs to the Serial Monitor.
- Documented key features, including:
  - Altitude measurement using BMP280.
  - Acceleration and jerk calculation using LSM6DS33.
  - NeoPixel LED color mapping for jerk values.
  - Data logging and real-time monitoring.
- Provided an overview of helper functions:
  - `scanI2CDevices()`, `getAltitude()`, `getAcceleration()`, `updateAccelHistory()`, and `computeJerk()`.

### Changes
- Organized the documentation into sections for better readability:
  - Overview, Key Features, Code Functionality, Data Logging, and Conclusion.
